# wsl2binds plugin

A helper tool for WSL2 for [omegga](https://github.com/brickadia-community/omegga).

This will not work or be useful on linux, WSL1, or anything that isn't WSL2.

## Install

* `git clone https://github.com/meshiest/omegga-wsl2binds wsl2binds` in `plugins` directory

## Why?

WSL2 does not allow "port forwarding" for UDP so UDP needs to be redirected from windows to the instance.
